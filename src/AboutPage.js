          <p className="mb-4 text-base">
            This ADHD support platform was created by a final year undergraduate student as part of a Computer Science Individual Project (CS3IP). The motivation behind the project was both personal and practical — to build a tool that helps people with ADHD and anxiety manage daily routines in a way that’s calming, focused, and emotionally supportive.

            Traditional productivity apps can be overwhelming, visually cluttered, and rigid. This project aims to do the opposite: provide a soft, gentle, web-based experience that encourages small wins, task streaks, and consistent routines without guilt or pressure. The app uses simple visual tools like streak tracking and progress bars to make progress feel visible and rewarding.

            The platform is built with React and Supabase and follows ADHD-friendly design principles — soft colours, minimal UI, emotionally affirming messages, and intuitive flows.
          </p>

            It’s completely free, requires no payment, and is open to anyone looking for a better way to navigate daily tasks with a little more kindness.
